Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries, including scikit-learn's LogisticRegression for logistic regression, and other utilities for data preprocessing and evaluation.
Data Preparation: Load your dataset and preprocess it as needed. This involves steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into features (independent variables) and the target variable.
Create a Logistic Regression Model: Instantiate a logistic regression model object. In scikit-learn, this is done using the LogisticRegression class.
Train the Model: Fit the logistic regression model to the training data. This is where the model learns the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable, aiming to predict the probability of each class.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model. This step involves making predictions on the test set and comparing them with the actual target values.
Use the Model: Once trained and evaluated, the model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
